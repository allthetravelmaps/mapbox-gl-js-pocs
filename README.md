# Mapbox GL JS Proof-of-concepts

A series of short POC's to ensure [Mapbox GL JS](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js) can do what I need it to do.

* [Change which remote style is in use dynamically](/openmaptiles-style-switcher/)
* [Alter a locally-defined style dynamically](/alter-style-dynamically/)
* [Style specific polygons by ID](/style-polygons-by-id/)
* [Remove water from styled polygons](/water-over-geojson-object/)
* [Staticly serve MVT tiles](/staticly-serving-mvt-tiles/)
